# Welcome to UltraDesk

Welcome to YPCloud! 
First, we need to set up our own working space.

## Telegram
1. Make sure you have joined these YPCloud groups on Telegram already:
    * clouder://c21
    * clockin://c21
    * ioc://c21
    * duty://c21
    * jboard://c21
2. Search the below Telegram bots and click `/start` to interact with them.
    * @JujueBot
    * @PinponboyBot
      * You may need authentication. Follow the step shown in chat box.
3. (optional) You can put all the YPCloud groups into a folder.
    * You can learn about Telegram chat folders [here](https://telegram.org/blog/folders).

## Jujue Account
* Create a Jujue account:
    1. Head to [account.ypcloud.com](https://account.ypcloud.com/#/login)
    2. Click on 'Sign Up' and create a username and password.
        (You can also choose to sign up with your Gmail / Facebook / Telegram if you want.)
    3. Sign in to confirm your new account.
    4. Head to [Jujue Browser](https://jujue.app/browser)
    5. Click the App Launcher button on the top right corner.
    6. Now you can use your account to access Gitwork, fBuilder, jBuilder, etc.

### Gitwork
1. Register a [Gitwork](https://gitwork.ypcloud.com/) (YPCloud Gitlab Server) account on and sign in.
2. Have someone add you as a Maintainer of the group "clouder-21".
3. Create your personal folder by clicking "New Project", and name it "c21-{Name}", where "{Name}" is your name.
4. In your newly created project, create your progress journal by clicking "+" to add a new file, and naming it "c21-{Name}-雲耕日誌.md", where "{Name}" is your name.

* Reminders: 
    * Remember to update your progress regularly.
    * Your code and other resources you develop at YPCloud will be stored in Gitwork.

### fBuilder
1. Sign in your Jujue account and open fBuilder.
2. Follow the [Tutorials](https://github.com/motebus/ultrabook/blob/main/Ultranet%20Apps/fbuilder%20User%20Guide.md#clocking-in) to create a simple flow that clocks-in to the Telegram channel clockin://c21 four times a day (09:00, 12:00, 18:00, and 00:00).

### jBuilder
