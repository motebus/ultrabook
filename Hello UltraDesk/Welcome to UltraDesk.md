2. Search the below Telegram bots and click `/start` to interact with them.
    * @JujueBot

         * You may need authentication. Follow the step shown in chat box.
3. (optional) You can put all the YPCloud groups into a folder.

        (You can also choose to sign up with your Gmail / Facebook / Telegram if you want.)
    3. Sign in to confirm your new account.
    4. Head to [Jujue Browser](https://jujue.app/browser)

    6. Now you can use your account to access Gitwork, fBuilder, jBuilder, etc.

### Gitwork
1. Register a [Gitwork](https://gitwork.ypcloud.com/) (YPCloud Gitlab Server) account on and sign in.
2. Have someone add you as a Maintainer of the group "clouder-21".
3. Create your personal folder by clicking "New Project", and name it "c21-{Name}", where "{Name}" is your name.
4. In your newly created project, create your progress journal by clicking "+" to add a new file, and naming it "c21-{Name}-雲耕日誌.md", where "{Name}" is your name.

* Reminders: 
    * Remember to update your progress regularly.
    * Your code and other resources you develop at YPCloud will be stored in Gitwork.
